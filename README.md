## <img src="./images/overview_icon.png" alt="Overview Icon" width="30"> Project Overview

In today's financial landscape, accurate credit risk assessment is crucial. This project leverages various machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their financial obligations. By building robust predictive models, we aim to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions, thereby reducing potential losses and fostering financial stability.

**Key Objectives:**

-   Comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing.
-   Implementation and comparison of various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
-   Rigorous model evaluation using appropriate metrics.
-   Clear and reproducible code.
-   Potential for deployment and integration into real-world applications.

This project explores several machine learning models for credit risk prediction. For instance, the `model_training_evaluation.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the implementation and comparison of:

-   **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.
    <img src="./images/logistic_regression.png" alt="Logistic Regression Diagram" width="250">
-   **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees.
    <img src="./images/random_forest.png" alt="Random Forest Diagram" width="300">
-   **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost):** A powerful boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially.
    <img src="./images/xgboost_logo.png" alt="XGBoost Logo" width="150">

The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
