# Credit Risk Modelling with Machine Learning

This repository, `credit_risk_modelling_ml`, focuses on building and analyzing machine learning models for assessing credit risk. The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for credit risk prediction, from data handling to model deployment.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

-   `.idea/`: Contains configuration files for development environments.
-   `app/`: Likely houses the application components for deploying or interacting with the credit risk model.
-   `artifacts/`: Stores trained machine learning models, preprocessed data, or other generated outputs from the modeling process.
-   `dataset/`: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the credit risk models.
-   `credit_risk_model_jupyter_notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook, which is expected to contain the core logic for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

## Technologies Used

The primary language used in this project is Jupyter Notebook, complemented by Python for scripting and data manipulation.

-   **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development, data exploration, and model experimentation.
-   **Python**: For various tasks including data processing, machine learning algorithm implementation, and potentially API development for the `app` module.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Dheeraj23-08/credit_risk_modelling_ml.git](https://github.com/Dheeraj23-08/credit_risk_modelling_ml.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd credit_risk_modelling_ml
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:** (Assuming a `requirements.txt` or similar file would be present for dependencies)
    ```bash
    # You might need to create a virtual environment first
    # python -m venv venv
    # source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is not currently in the repository, but would be necessary for a full setup.)*
4.  **Explore the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Open `credit_risk_model_jupyter_notebook.ipynb` to understand the data, modeling techniques, and results.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
